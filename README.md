# Manga Ingest With Upscaling

## Overview

MangaIngestWithUpscaling is a **Blazor-based web application** designed to **ingest, process, and automatically upscale manga images**. 

## Features

- **Manga ingestion**: Ingest Mangas into a library structure useful for [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/) and [Komga](https://komga.org/).
  - Keep track of mangas known under many different titles. This software will not just put them into the same folder, but also change the ComicInfo.xml file to reflect the new title.
  - Change the title of a manga. This may sound simple, but going back and changing the ComicInfo.xml file of a lot of chapters is quite a hassle.
- **Image upscaling**: Enhance image resolution with [MangaJaNai](https://github.com/the-database/mangajanai) upscaling models. 

## Usage

1. **Set up a library** through the UI.
2. **Ingest manga** by uploading putting the manga into the ingest folder you just configured.
3. Profit!

## Installation

The preferred way to run the application is through Docker. Below is an example docker-compose file to get you started with CUDA. See below for ROCm (AMD) support.

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  mangaingestwithupscaling:
    image: ghcr.io/lolle2000la/manga-ingest-with-upscaling:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      TZ: #your timezone here
      Ingest_Upscaler__SelectedDeviceIndex: 0 # if you have multiple GPUs, you can select which one to use
      Ingest_Upscaler__UseFp16: true # if you want to use fp16 instead of fp32, preferred if you have a GPU that supports it
      Ingest_Upscaler__UseCPU: false # if you want to use the CPU instead of the GPU
      # Kavita integration
      #Ingest_Kavita__BaseUrl: http://kavita:5000 # the base URL of your Kavita instance
      #Ingest_Kavita__ApiKey: #Your API key here
      #Ingest_Kavita__Enabled: True # defaults to false
      # OIDC Authentication (v0.12.0+)
      #Ingest_OIDC__Enabled: false # Set to true to enable OIDC authentication
      #Ingest_OIDC__Authority: # Your OIDC provider's authority URL (e.g., https://authentik.yourdomain.com/application/o/your-app/)
      #Ingest_OIDC__ClientId: # Your OIDC client ID
      #Ingest_OIDC__ClientSecret: # Your OIDC client secret
      #Ingest_OIDC__MetadataAddress: # Optional: Full URL to the OIDC discovery document (e.g., https://authentik.yourdomain.com/application/o/your-app/.well-known/openid-configuration)
                                   # Usually not needed if Authority is set correctly.
    volumes:
      - /path/to/store/appdata:/data # for storing the database and logs
      - /path/to/store/models:/models # for storing the upscaling models. 
      # ... other folders you want to be able to access from the container
      - /path/to/ingest:/ingest
      - /path/to/target:/target
    ports:
      - 8080:8080 # the web interface will be available on this port
    #user: '1000:1000' # change the user/group for improved security. Note: The user must be part of the 'video' group and have the correct permissions for its mount points.
    # Make sure you have the nvidia-container-toolkit installed on your host.
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

If you run a ROCm-compatible AMD GPU, you can use the following docker-compose file:

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  mangaingestwithupscaling:
    image: ghcr.io/lolle2000la/manga-ingest-with-upscaling:latest-rocm
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      TZ: #your timezone here
      Ingest_Upscaler__SelectedDeviceIndex: 0 # if you have multiple GPUs, you can select which one to use
      Ingest_Upscaler__UseFp16: true # if you want to use fp16 instead of fp32, preferred if you have a GPU that supports it
      Ingest_Upscaler__UseCPU: false # if you want to use the CPU instead of the GPU
      # Kavita integration
      #Ingest_Kavita__BaseUrl: http://kavita:5000 # the base URL of your Kavita instance
      #Ingest_Kavita__ApiKey: #Your API key here
      #Ingest_Kavita__Enabled: True # defaults to false
      # OIDC Authentication (v0.12.0+)
      #Ingest_OIDC__Enabled: false # Set to true to enable OIDC authentication
      #Ingest_OIDC__Authority: # Your OIDC provider's authority URL (e.g., https://authentik.yourdomain.com/application/o/your-app/)
      #Ingest_OIDC__ClientId: # Your OIDC client ID
      #Ingest_OIDC__ClientSecret: # Your OIDC client secret
      #Ingest_OIDC__MetadataAddress: # Optional: Full URL to the OIDC discovery document (e.g., https://authentik.yourdomain.com/application/o/your-app/.well-known/openid-configuration)
                                   # Usually not needed if Authority is set correctly.
      # Rest is same as for the CUDA version
    volumes:
      - /path/to/store/appdata:/data # for storing the database and logs
      - /path/to/store/models:/models # for storing the upscaling models. 
      # ... other folders you want to be able to access from the container
      - /path/to/ingest:/ingest
      - /path/to/target:/target
    ports:
      - 8080:8080 # the web interface will be available on this port
    #user: '1000:1000' # change the user/group for improved security. Note: The user must be part of the 'video' group and have the correct permissions for its mount points.
    # The following lines are necessary to run the container with a ROCm-compatible AMD GPU.
    # See https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/how-to/docker.html for more information.
    devices:
      - /dev/kfd
      - /dev/dri
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
```

I do not have an AMD GPU, so I cannot test this. If you have any issues, please open an issue.

### OIDC Configuration (v0.12.0+)

For version 0.12.0 and later, you can configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. This allows you to use an external identity provider instead of the built-in user accounts.

To enable and configure OIDC when running with Docker, add the following environment variables to your `docker-compose.yml` under the `mangaingestwithupscaling.services.environment` section:

```yaml
# ... other environment variables ...
      Ingest_OIDC__Enabled: "true"  # Set to "true" to enable OIDC, "false" to disable
      Ingest_OIDC__Authority: "https://your-oidc-provider.com/auth/realms/your-realm" # URL of your OIDC provider (e.g., Keycloak, Authentik)
      Ingest_OIDC__ClientId: "your-client-id" # The Client ID registered with your OIDC provider
      Ingest_OIDC__ClientSecret: "your-client-secret" # The Client Secret for your OIDC client
      # Optional: Full URL to the OIDC discovery document. 
      # If your Authority URL is already the discovery endpoint (e.g., ends with /.well-known/openid-configuration), 
      # this might not be needed.
      # Ingest_OIDC__MetadataAddress: "https://your-oidc-provider.com/auth/realms/your-realm/.well-known/openid-configuration" 
# ... rest of your docker-compose.yml ...
```

Note that in most cases, you either need to set `Ingest_OIDC__Authority` or `Ingest_OIDC__MetadataAddress`, but not both. The `Authority` is often sufficient as long as the discovery document is accessible at the standard path (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`).

**Redirect URIs for your OIDC Provider:**

When configuring the OIDC client in your identity provider, you will need to specify the following redirect URIs:

*   **Login Redirect URI:** `https://<your-app-base-url>/signin-oidc`
    *   Replace `<your-app-base-url>` with the actual base URL where MangaIngestWithUpscaling is accessible (e.g., `https://manga.example.com`).
*   **Post-Logout Redirect URI:** `https://<your-app-base-url>/`
    *   This is where users will be redirected after logging out from the OIDC provider. You can adjust this to a different page if needed, but the application root is a common choice.

Make sure your OIDC provider is configured to accept these URIs.

**Problems when running behind a reverse proxy:**

If you encounter issues with OIDC authentication when running behind a reverse proxy, ensure that the proxy is correctly forwarding the necessary headers. You may need to configure your reverse proxy to pass through headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and `X-Forwarded-Host` to maintain the correct request context.

In the case of nginx in particular, you might have to add the following configuration to your nginx server block (shoutout to [@dankennedy](https://github.com/DuendeArchive/IdentityServer4/issues/1670#issuecomment-340774293)):

```nginx
proxy_buffer_size          128k;

proxy_buffers              4 256k;

proxy_busy_buffers_size    256k;
```

Without this, after being redirected back to the application, you might be faced with a 502 Bad Gateway error or a blank page.

## Building Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK or later

## Running from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/MangaIngestWithUpscaling.git
   cd MangaIngestWithUpscaling
   ```

## Configuration

The application relies on `appsettings.json` for configuration. Modify the connection strings and other parameters as needed.
Alternatively, you can use environment variables to override the configuration values.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=data.db;Pooling=false",
    "LoggingConnection": "Data Source=logs.db;Pooling=false"
  },
  "Serilog": {
    "Using": [ "Serilog.Sinks.Console", "Serilog.Sinks.SQLite" ],
    "MinimumLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Override": {
        "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
      }
    },
    "Enrich": [ "FromLogContext" ]
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Upscaler": {
    "UseFp16": true,
    "UseCPU": false,
    "SelectedDeviceIndex": 0
  },
  "OIDC": {
    "Enabled": false, // Set to true to enable OIDC
    "Authority": "YOUR_OIDC_AUTHORITY_URL", // e.g., https://authentik.example.com/application/o/slug/
    "MetadataAddress": "YOUR_FULL_DISCOVERY_DOCUMENT_URL", // Optional, Authority is often sufficient if it's the discovery endpoint
    "ClientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "ClientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
  }
}

```
